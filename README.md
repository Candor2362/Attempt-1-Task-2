# **Attempt-1-Task-2**

Actions taken in the project:
- Created new First Person project. Changed nothing.
- Created two "button" (MyBP_Button_Old, MyBP_Button_New) and "door" (MyBP_Door) blueprints, which are in "MyBPs" folder and placed them on the map.
- Slightly edited FirstPersonCharacter blueprint Event Graph to try interacting with MyBP_Button_New actor on the map with apparently no success.
